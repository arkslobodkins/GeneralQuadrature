GeneralQuadrature is a numerical integration algorithm 
for computing numerical quadrature rules of arbitrary
degree and dimension for the following domains: cube, simplex, 
cube x simplex, simplex x simplex,  cube x simplex x simplex. 
Computational cost increases rapidly with the increase in dimension. 
For example, quadrature of degree 10  and dimension 2 is computed in 
half a second, whereas quadrature of dimension and degree 10 takes a few hours. 

Source code is located in ./src directory. 
Makefile is located in ./make directory. 
All headers of the source code are located in ./headers directory.  
Quadrature rules and results are stored in ./results directory. 

To compile the code: go to ./make directory and enter "make". The code should
compile and produce ./Driver.x executable. 

To execute the code: In ./make enter "Driver.x CommandLineArguments".  
The first entry in the command line arguments is a string that specifies type 
of the domain. It should be capitalized, otherwise it will not run. 
The remaining arguments are integers that specify dimension of the domain 
and degree of precision. 

Command line arguments should take one of the following forms:
CUBE dim deg
SIMPLEX dim deg
CUBESIMPLEX dim1 dim2 deg
SIMPLEXSIMPLEX dim1 dim2 deg
CUBESIMPLEXSIMPLEX dim1 dim2 dim3 deg
